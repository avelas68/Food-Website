# Food-Website
Uses Spoonacular API to locate food items. The user types in a specific food they want in the search menu and restaurants within the area will appear if they have that food item in their menus. The user is then prompted to view a specific meal on their menu which lists the nutritional content as well as the caloric value. The languages I used for this website were vue.js, HTML, npm, and node.js.
